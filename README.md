# 🚀 Git & GitHub 101: The Ultimate Beginner's Guide

Welcome to the world of **Git** and **GitHub**!  
This guide is designed for beginners who want to start version-controlling their code, collaborating with others, and becoming confident with modern software development workflows.

## 📌 What is Git?

**Git** is a free and open-source **version control system** that helps you track changes in your codebase over time.

### ✅ Key Features:
- Track every change made to files
- Roll back to previous versions
- Collaborate with others on the same project
- Work offline on your local machine

---

## 🌐 What is GitHub?

**GitHub** is a cloud-based hosting platform that uses Git for version control.  
It lets you:
- Store your Git repositories online
- Collaborate with others across the globe
- Share your work publicly or privately
- Contribute to open-source projects

> ⚠️ Git runs on your computer. GitHub is where you share the project with others.

## 🛠️ Basic Git Commands

Here are the most essential Git commands to get started:

git init                 # Initialize a new Git repo
git status              # Check status of files
git add <filename>      # Stage a specific file
git add .               # Stage all files
git commit -m "message" # Commit your changes with a message
git push                # Push changes to GitHub
